            <li>What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?</li>
            <answer>Unobtrusive Javascript is a general approach to write Javascript code in web page. 
                The main idea is not writing javascript code in html. 
                And the reason we use Unobtrusive Javascript is to run our code without any problem on client side. 
                Because user browser may ignore my javascript completely because they don't support Javascript like old style 
                and Even browser can support users may turn it off for security reason etc.,</answer>
